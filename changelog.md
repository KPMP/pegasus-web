- updated code to call new graphql endpoints (because of renames)

## Release 2.4 (released 07/08/2024)
Brief summary of what's in this release:
- fix minor overlay issue in Explorer when gene not found
- added new "All" column to Atlas home page and Explorer home page tables

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes include any database updates needed, if we need to edit any files on system (like .env or certs, etc). Things that are outside of the code itself that need changed for the system to work.


### Non-breaking changes

Just a place to keep track of things that have changed in the code that we may want to pay special attention to when smoke testing, etc.
